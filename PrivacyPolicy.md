# Privacy Policy for AudioDown

**Effective Date:** June 11, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of Your information when You use the AudioDown Chrome Extension (the "Service") and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

### Interpretation and Definitions

* **Service** refers to the AudioDown Chrome Extension.
* **We** ("We", "Us", or "Our") refers to the developer of the AudioDown extension.
* **You** means the individual using the Service.

### Data Collection and Use

**AudioDown is designed with user privacy as a core principle.**

* **No Personal Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, location, or IP address.

* **No Web History or User Activity Tracking:** The extension does not track your Browse history, clicks, or any other user activity. All operations are performed locally on your computer.

* **Ephemeral Data Handling:** The Service's sole function is to scan the webpage You are currently viewing to find links to audio files. These links are displayed to You within the extension's popup and are used only to initiate a download when requested. This information is processed ephemerally and is never stored or sent to any remote server.

### Extension Permissions

To function correctly, AudioDown requires a few specific permissions, each for a narrow purpose:

* **`activeTab` & `tabs`:** To know which webpage to scan for audio files when you activate the extension.
* **`scripting`:** To run the script that finds the audio links on that active page.
* **`downloads`:** To use the browser's download manager to save the files you select.

No information from these permissions is ever collected or stored.

### Third-Party Services

The AudioDown extension does not use any third-party services, servers, or APIs. All code is self-contained within the extension package to ensure your privacy and security.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
